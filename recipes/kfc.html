            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>50g cornflour</li>
            <li>vegetable oil</li>
            <li>sesame seeds</li>
            <li>spring onions</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons gochujang</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>To make the sauce, put all the ingredients in a saucepan and simmer gently until syrupy, so around 3-4 mins. Take off the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken wings with salt, pepper and the grated ginger. Toss the chicken with the cornflour until completely coated.</li>
            <li>Heat about 2cm of vegetable oil in a large frying pan over a medium/high heat. Fry the chicken wings for 8-10 mins until crisp, turning halfway. Remove from the oil and place on kitchen paper. Leave to cool slightly (around 2 mins).</li>
            <li>Reheat the sauce, and toss the crispy chicken wings in it. Tip into a bowl and top with the sesame seeds and sliced spring onions.</li>
        </ol>
